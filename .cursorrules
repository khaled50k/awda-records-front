Style & Structure

Always write complete, production-ready code.

Prefer modular structure: hooks, utils, components, types.

Special Rule for Page Creation

When asked to create a page, you must:

Read existing folders: services/, store/, app/ (or pages/) to understand existing structure.

Follow the same style, patterns, and conventions.

Implement full page code including:

page.tsx

related components

hooks (if needed)

types/interfaces

integration with services and store

Ensure the new page matches the projectâ€™s architecture.
